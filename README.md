# KiTTY-mariana
A Mariana based colorscheme for KiTTY. Lightly modified from the Mariana theme in [putty-color-themes](https://github.com/AlexAkulov/putty-color-themes) which is based on Sublime Text's Mariana theme.

To use, go to `kitty/sessions/your_session_file` and use the data in colors.txt to overwrite the colors.
