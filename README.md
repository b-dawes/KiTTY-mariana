# KiTTY-mariana
A Mariana based colorscheme for KiTTY. Lightly modified from the Mariana theme in [putty-color-themes](https://github.com/AlexAkulov/putty-color-themes) which is based on Sublime Text's Mariana theme.

To use, set-up KiTTY to run in portable mode as described [here](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/?page=Portability). Then go to into the `sessions` directory in the directory containing your KiTTY executable. Open up the file for the session you want to change and use the data in colors.txt to overwrite the colors.
